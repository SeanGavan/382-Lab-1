=========

Objectives
----------
The objective of Lab 1 is to write the first complete assembly language program using what has been learned in class. The lab will give practice in using assemply to integrate higher-level if/then/else and looping constructs. To do so, the task is to write an assembly program that works as a four function calculator.
Preliminary design
